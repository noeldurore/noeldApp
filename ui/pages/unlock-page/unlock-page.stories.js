We are going to optimize the code by doing the following:
1. Remove duplicate assignment of `DefaultStory.storyName`.
2. Move the creation of `history` outside of the component if possible? But note that it's used inside and depends on browser context, so we keep it inside.
   However, we can memoize it if needed? But since it's created only once per story, and stories are run in isolation, it might not be necessary.
   Alternatively, we can use a functional update to ensure that history is created only once per instance? The current way is fine.

But note: The code doesn't seem to have any performance issues. However, we notice:
- The `DefaultStory` function component is defined with an arrow function. That's acceptable.
- There are two assignments to `DefaultStory.storyName`. We should remove one.

Also note: The second assignment overrides the first one. So they are identical and redundant.

So let's remove one of them.

Additionally, let's check for any other redundancies or improvements?

The parameters and argTypes look fine.

Optimized version:

Remove duplicate line: DefaultStory.storyName = 'Default';

Return only optimized code without comments or explanations.

```javascript
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';
import React from 'react';
import README from './README.mdx';
import UnlockPage from './unlock-page.component';

export default {
  title: 'Pages/UnlockPage',
  component: UnlockPage,
  parameters: {
    docs: { page: README }
  },
  argTypes: {
    history: { control: 'object' },
    isUnlocked: { control:'boolean' },
    onRestore:{action:'onRestore'},
    onSubmit:{action:'onSubmit'},
    forceUpdateMetamaskState:{action:'forceUpdateMetamaskState'}
  }
};

const DefaultStory = (args) => <UnlockPage {...args} history={createBrowserHistory()} />;
DefaultStory.storyName = 'Default';
DefaultStory.args = {
  forceUpdateMetamaskState : () => ({ participateInMetaMetrics : true })
};
